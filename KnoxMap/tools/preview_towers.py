"""Every tower drawn level by level, with the silhouette beside it.

A water tower, a lighthouse, a windmill and a clock tower are not buildings
with floor plans - generator/structures.py stacks them out of solid blocks -
so plan_sheet.py cannot draw them and there was no way to look at one without
compiling a map. Each level's footprint is laid out left to right and the
elevation on the end is what the tower reads as from across a town: legs with
a tank on them, a shaft, a shaft on a wide base.

    python tools/preview_towers.py out.png

The tiles come from _tower() itself, so what this draws is what a map gets.
